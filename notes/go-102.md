# Go 102 Class
This talk was about project structure, packages, how to build a project, and dependency management.

Instructor: Dimitrios Arethas

## Pre-reqs
* [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html)


## Project Structure

Go has a few different patterns of organizing code:

* flat layout - functions are organized by file names with a main.go function keeping the main logic centralized; all files in one main folder
* grouping by functions - handlers, models, and storage all stored in separate folders within the main repo
* grouping by module - grouping by behavior like reviews/customers/storage/etc
* grouping by context - DDD (data driven design); adding/reviewing/listening/etc


Advice from the instructor: 
* two top level directories: cmd (for binaries) and pkg (for packages)
* group by context, not generic functionality
* dependencies in their own package
* main package initializes and ties everything together
* avoid global scope and init functions
* make it consistent, easy to read, and easy to build off of
* they "made the mistake" of doing microservices in the past

## Packages

Package - one or more source files that declare the content of the application

Design Philosophy:
* packages must be purposeful: provide, _NOT_ contain
* named with the intent to describe what it provides
* not become a dumping ground of disperate concerns 
    * no utils pacakges!
* intuitive and simple to use
* seek to reduce, minimize, and simplify its code base 

## Dependency Management

You should just be able to use Go modules - this uses SemVer, which works with "go get". 

Modules - collection of packages; uses MVS and SIV

    MVS - minimal version select; very simple and easy to understand
    SIV - semantic import versioning; adding a semantic version in your import path; generally used to have the "same package" but breaks compatibility

Popular packages include:
* net/http
* database/sql
* encoding/json
    * json to Go struct has easy apps online to be able to just copy and paste
